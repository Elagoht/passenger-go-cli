# Passenger Go CLI Tool

Passenger Go is a self-hosted passphrase manager that allows you to manage your passwords using a Web UI. But it also provides an API for other applications to use. Here, this tool allows you to use Passenger Go in your terminal.

## Getting Started

Assuming you have your own Passenger Go instance running on a server and you have a URL to access it. You will need to configure server connection first.

```bash
passenger-go server <your-server-url>
```

Now you can use Passenger Go CLI to manage your passwords.
